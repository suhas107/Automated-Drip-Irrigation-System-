 Automated Drip Irrigation System
 Overview

An Arduino-based automated drip irrigation system built using Embedded C.
The system uses soil moisture feedback to control a water pump and optimize water usage by approximately 25%.

 Features

Soil moisture sensor-based irrigation

User-defined moisture threshold

Multi-soil configuration using structs

Manual override using push button

Serial monitor menu interface

Automated pump (DC motor) control

 Technologies Used

Arduino

Embedded C

Tinkercad (Simulation)

Soil Moisture Sensor

DC Motor

 How It Works

System reads soil moisture level.

If moisture is below threshold → Pump turns ON.

If moisture is above threshold → Pump turns OFF.

User can override manually using push button.

Result

Achieved ~25% reduction in water usage compared to fixed-time irrigation.
